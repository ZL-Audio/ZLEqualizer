**Please NOTICE**:

## Build from Source

### Install Dependencies

Please make sure `Clang` (`AppleClang 16+` or `LLVM/Clang 17+`), `cmake` (minimum 3.25), `ninja` are installed and configured on your OS.

On Windows (with Intel chips), you may install IntelÂ® Integrated Performance Primitives and set its path as an environment variable `IPP_DIR`. It is not a hard requirement as KFR has already been used for SIMD/DFT acceleration.

On Linux, you can install the remaining dependencies with the following command:

```console
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt install libasound2-dev libx11-dev libxinerama-dev libxext-dev libfreetype-dev libfontconfig1-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libglu1-mesa-dev
```

### Clone and Build

Once you have set up the environment, you can clone the ZL Equalizer code, populate all submodules, then configure & build the code. Please set the variable `ZL_JUCE_FORMATS` as a list of formats that you want, e.g., `"VST3;LV2"`.
```console
git clone https://github.com/ZL-Audio/ZLEqualizer
cd ZLEqualizer
git submodule update --init --recursive
cmake -B Builds -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DKFR_ENABLE_MULTIARCH=OFF -DZL_JUCE_FORMATS="VST3;LV2" .
cmake --build Builds --config Release
```
After building, the plugins should have been copied to the corresponding folders. If you want to disable the copy process, you can pass `-DZL_JUCE_COPY_PLUGIN=FALSE`, find the binary folders under `Builds/ZLEqualizer_artefacts/Release` and copy them manually.

> If there are multiple compilers on your OS, you may need to pass extra flags to maker sure that cmake uses `LLVM/Clang`. On Linux, you may pass `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++`. On Windows, you may pass `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-cl -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang-cl`.

> AAX plug-ins need to be digitally signed using PACE Anti-Piracy's signing tools before they will run in commercially available versions of Pro Tools.
